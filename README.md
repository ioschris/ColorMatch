# ColorMatch by Chris Harris

ColorMatch is a simple project created in C# to show users the functionality of the Drawing class as well as many other useful methods that can be used throughout many different projects. With ColorMatch, you are able to choose from a list of default colors, create a custom color based on your needs, as well as capture a color on screen and obtain their RGB and hex values. This is a very simple, yet effective tool for developers and graphic designers that deal with these values regularly.
